Important code files so far:

// handles user authentication and authorization logic
// technically backend code that handles the processes of logging in and managing user sessions.

auth-server/authorization/authorization_code/App.js

// contains the front end code for the app
// right now has an example I found from a setup video that shows what song a user is currently playing. 
// works with your phone, the desktop app, or the website at least (all I tested)

client/src/App.js
client/src/App.css

To run this code, use npm install to install all the react dependencies and such, and then use npm run start in the terminal on VS Code
